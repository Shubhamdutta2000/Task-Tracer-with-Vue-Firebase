Data is stored persistently\n * across sessions.\n *\n * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence\n * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\n/**\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the primary client object store.\n */\nfunction ki(t) {\n    return kr(t, Zn.store);\n}\n\n/**\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the client metadata object store.\n */ function xi(t) {\n    return kr(t, fr.store);\n}\n\n/**\n * Generates a string used as a prefix when storing data in IndexedDB and\n * LocalStorage.\n */ function Ci(t, e) {\n    // Use two different prefix formats:\n    //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID . databaseID / ...\n    //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID / ...\n    // projectIDs are DNS-compatible names and cannot contain dots\n    // so there's no danger of collisions.\n    var n = t.projectId;\n    return t.isDefaultDatabase || (n += \".\" + t.database), \"firestore/\" + e + \"/\" + n + \"/\"\n    /**\n * @license\n * Copyright 2020 Google LLC\n *\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */;\n}\n\nvar Ri = function(t, e) {\n    this.progress = t, this.wn = e;\n}, Oi = /** @class */ function() {\n    function t(t, e, n) {\n        this.Ue = t, this._n = e, this.Ut = n\n        /**\n     * Get the local view of the document identified by `key`.\n     *\n     * @returns Local view of the document or null if we don't have any cached\n     * state for it.\n     */;\n    }\n    return t.prototype.mn = function(t, e) {\n        var n = this;\n        return this._n.getAllMutationBatchesAffectingDocumentKey(t, e).next((function(r) {\n            return n.yn(t, e, r);\n        }));\n    }, \n    /** Internal version of `getDocument` that allows reusing batches. */ t.prototype.yn = function(t, e, n) {\n        return this.Ue.getEntry(t, e).next((function(t) {\n            for (var e = 0, r = n; e < r.length; e++) {\n                r[e].applyToLocalView(t);\n            }\n            return t;\n        }));\n    }, \n    // Returns the view of the given `docs` as they would appear after applying\n    // all mutations in the given `batches`.\n    t.prototype.gn = function(t, e) {\n        t.forEach((function(t, n) {\n            for (var r = 0, i = e; r < i.length; r++) {\n                i[r].applyToLocalView(n);\n            }\n        }));\n    }, \n    /**\n     * Gets the local view of the documents identified by `keys`.\n     *\n     * If we don't have cached state for a document in `keys`, a NoDocument will\n     * be stored for that key in the resulting set.\n     */\n    t.prototype.pn = function(t, e) {\n        var n = this;\n        return this.Ue.getEntries(t, e).next((function(e) {\n            return n.En(t, e).next((function() {\n                return e;\n            }));\n        }));\n    }, \n    /**\n     * Applies the local view the given `baseDocs` without retrieving documents\n     * from the local store.\n     */\n    t.prototype.En = function(t, e) {\n        var n = this;\n        return this._n.getAllMutationBatchesAffectingDocumentKeys(t, e).next((function(t) {\n            return n.gn(e, t);\n        }));\n    }, \n    /**\n     * Performs a query against the local view of all documents.\n     *\n     * @param transaction - The persistence transaction.\n     * @param query - The query to match documents against.\n     * @param sinceReadTime - If not set to SnapshotVersion.min(), return only\n     *     documents that have been read since this snapshot version (exclusive).\n     */\n    t.prototype.getDocumentsMatchingQuery = function(t, e, n) {\n        /**\n * Returns whether the query matches a single document by path (rather than a\n * collection).\n */\n        return function(t) {\n            return ut.isDocumentKey(t.path) && null === t.collectionGroup && 0 === t.filters.length;\n        }(e) ?
